1. PreferencesManager is elastic now, but support nesting, arrays & hashes would be great.
2. There is an empty components, also known as marker interfaces. I dont want to use that.
   The idea is to implement somewhat i call markers, that serves for the same purpose.
   They should reside along with entity components in EntityManager.
